# ML-Model-Development
The aim of project is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on the features given in the dataset.

## Problem Statement
The increasing prevalence of diabetes worldwide poses a significant public health challenge. Early detection and proactive management of diabetes are crucial in preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on the features given in the dataset.
The model should assist healthcare providers in making timely interventions and implementing personalized strategies for diabetes prevention. The ultimate goal is to enhance proactive
healthcare measures, reduce the burden of diabetes-related complications, and improve overall public health outcomes. This dataset comprises crucial sign and symptom data of
individuals who either exhibit early signs of diabetes or are at risk of developing diabetes.

## 1. Import Libraries/Dataset
<br>a.	Download the dataset.</br>
<br>b.	Import the required libraries.</br>

## 2.	Data Visualization and Exploration 

<br>a.	Printed 2 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset and if the target matches with them.</br>
<br>b.	Provided appropriate data visualizations to get an insight about the dataset.</br>
<br>c.	Done the correlational analysis on the dataset. Provided a visualization for the same.</br>

## 3.	Data Pre-processing and cleaning

<br>a.	Done the appropriate pre-processing of the data like identifying NULL or Missing Values if any, handling of outliers if present in the dataset, skewed data etc.</br>
<br>b.	Applied appropriate feature engineering techniques. Applied the feature transformation techniques like Standardization, Normalization, etc.</br>

## 4.	Model Building

<br>a.	Split the dataset into training and test sets.</br>
<br>i.	Train = 80 % Test = 20% </br>
<br>ii.	Tried to split the dataset with different ratios of your choice.</br>
<br>b.	Build model using Logistic model and decision tree.</br>
<br>i.	Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees, maximum depth) using cross-validation.</br>

## 5.	Performance Evaluation

<br>a.	Compared the performance of the Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using appropriate evaluation metrics.</br>
<br>b.	Provided insights into which model performs better and why.</br>

## 6. Implement predictive models/classifiers using the following classification approaches:
<br>	Logistic Regression</br>
<br>	Decision tree</br>
<br>	Ensemble Methods (any one of your choice)</br>
<br>	K-Nearest Neighbour</br>

### 7. Compare the performances of each model/classifier considering the given dataset using different evaluation measures such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC. Shown the comparison chart in Python notebook.

### 8. Identify the model, which is the best amongst all the models that have been trained.
